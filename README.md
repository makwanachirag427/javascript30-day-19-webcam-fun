## Overview

In today's challenge, we'll build a web application that utilizes the user's webcam to apply various fun and creative filters or effects to the video feed. We'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve this.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage and the video element to display the webcam feed.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the webpage and any custom styles for the video or effects.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file where we'll write the logic to access the webcam, apply filters, and manipulate the video feed.

## Setup

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports webcam access (e.g., Chrome, Firefox). The browser will prompt you for permission to access the webcam.


    - Implement any additional features or creative functionalities you want to add, like taking snapshots, adding stickers, etc.
